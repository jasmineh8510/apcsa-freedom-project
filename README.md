# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Jasmine Hidalgo**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study game engines such as UE5 and Unity in order to help me make a scavenger hunt game.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Just like any other game, it is meant to give simple fun to anyone who would like to play it.
##### CONS
* Other than enjoyment there may not be any significant benefits.
