### Looking for a game engine
Over the past few weeks I have been figuring out what I want to do for my next project. Last year I made a pinball game and seeing people have fun with it at the expo I presented in made me realize my enjoyment for making games. So this year from day 1 I decided I wanted to make a game. With this in mind I knew I needed to find a game engine so I looked up various game engines. As I thought more about my project I envisioned what I may want my project to be and wanted to make a game with a complex 3D enviroment. This made it easier to look for a game engine because I could rule out the ones for just 2d games. In my search for game engines that provide good 3d graphics I came accross [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).
