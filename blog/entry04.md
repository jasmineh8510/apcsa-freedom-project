### Attempting with UE5
Over the past few weeks I have attempted to create the project. I started by making a base map and setting up the character which went over fine. Then when I started to make the pickup system things started to go wrong. The gist of what I was trying to code was that each of the cans were going to be give a class that would allow them to be picked up by the player. When the player presses e the object will switch positions and go into the user's hand. To make it go into the user's hand I had to manually create a version of the object, make it a child of the hand, and manually rigg the object in the hand. Even after going through very confusing measure to make up a pickup system nothing would work and the error log wouldn't tell me what was the issue. I tried redoing and attempting many different things, however nothing has worked out which made any progress come to a halt.

### Switching Plans
Due to time contraints and the complexity of UE5 I am making the choice to swap my engine to Unity. I beleive that Unity will be easier for me to use and navigate. The biggest challenge will be trying to learn a small bit of c# in order to make scripts. However I have heard it is similar to java, and if that is the case it shouldn't be too bad.

### EDP/ Skills
In the engineering design process I am currently at stage 5(Creation) and 6(Testing). I've made many attempts and have tested many times to see if I can get the project to work. I've had to embrace failure after failure attempting to make this project. However, as long as I adapt and grow I beleive it's possible to make something.
