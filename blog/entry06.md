### Elevator Pitch
Before I knew it, time came to present at the expo. I did not have a plan for my pitch when the time came. I didn't know how I was going to present my project, let alone visually. That is when I came up with the idea to make a mini slideshow. This way, I can put anything that came to mind on slides, this way I can figure out how to put it into words. My main issue was figuring out how to present it. I didn't know how to upload it to a webpage. I opted to record a video of my project demo. I tried using my windows screen recorder but it never worked because Unity doesn't show up. Then I looked up how to get a demo recording in Unity. It turns out there is a recording feature that can record gameplay. I used this feature to make a recording and after I was done I found it in the recordings folder of my project. After this I used [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) to edit the footage to my liking. After editing the footage I was able to export it as both a video and gif. I put both of them on the slideshow. I then customized the slides to make it look appealing and in alignment with what I wanted to say. Making [the slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iHuNQLbpLvJitVvq4LzMHQaYa46vZkRyvKd-1YV5fkc/edit?usp=sharing) helped me have an idea of what I wanted to say. After practicing my pitch a few times, I was able to give a good presentation to the judges.

### In Class Presentation
I had more preperation for the in class presentation. I had some trouble making the slides look nice because the slide theme websites were all blocked. In order to get a theme I figured out I had to download a slide theme on another account as a powerpoint. Then I had to upload it to my school account and convert. After this I had the theme, the topics I wanted to speak on, my screenshots, and my takeaways. I made [my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11pHvo3cMQut-5OxekJXQzPLwr-tqhxDpO8Van4T5QKs/edit?usp=sharing) more like an accomidation to what I had to say, rather than having detail heavy slides. I talked about my game, my switch to unity and all the problems I faced in a simple way. As I've done more presentations over the years, I've gotten a lot better at public speaking. In the end my presentation went very smoothly and I got a 9/10.

### EDP / Skills
I am currently at stage 8(Communicating) of the engineering design process. I have communicated my project to others while also making sure to be considerate about how I do so. I made sure to simplify the way I present to make it easy to understand for people.

### Future Plans and Reflection
Even after my school year, and after I learn more in Unity, I would like to return to this project to finish it in its entirety. This project has been a very difficult one. Struggling with UE5 and transitioning to Unity and many other things made things difficult. However, I'm still greatful for trying to see this through.
